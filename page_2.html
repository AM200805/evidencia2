    <p><i><b>1-.</b>VERIFY THE SOURCE OF INFORMATION OF YOUR INCOMING EMAILS</i> <br>
        Your bank will never ask you to send your passwords or personal data by mail. Never answer these types of questions and if you have the slightest doubt, call your bank directly to clarify it.</p>
    <p><i><b>2-.</b>ENTER YOUR CONFIDENTIAL DATA ONLY ON SECURE WEBSITES</i> <br>
        'Secure' websites must begin with 'https://' and the icon of a small closed padlock must appear in your browser.</p>
    <p><i><b>3-.</b>BE INFORMED PERIODICALLY ABOUT THE EVOLUTION OF MALWARE</i> <br>
        If you want to keep up to date with the latest malware attacks, recommendations or advice to avoid any danger on the Internet.</p>
    <p><i><b>4-.</b>USE STRONG PASSWORDS</i><br>
        Create passwords that are unique to each site. There are multiple tools on the Internet that will help you manage them.
        Mix different characters, interspersing them with uppercase and lowercase letters.
        Change your passwords frequently.
    </p>
    <p><i><b>5-.</b>BEWARE OF SHARED COMPUTERS</i><br>
        log out or forget passwords on the server. Don't forget to limit information about your family or loved ones either. Avoid uploading photos of your children or any minor in your family if it is not necessary.
